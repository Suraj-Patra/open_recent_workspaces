# open_recent_workspaces

## Process :

1. Install Node.
2. Clone the directory.
3. Open the commands.txt file, and write the commands for each program.

    Ex :

    ```
        subl : /home/suraj/Documents

        subl : /home/suraj/Desktop

        cd : /home/suraj/Documents

        cd : /home/suraj/Desktop
    ```

    Rules :

        1. Separate each command with newline
        2. Separate a command's parts with a ':' colon.
        3. A command can have only two parts, meaning you can't have two colons in a command.
        4. You may or may not add space around the ':' colon.
        5. The 'cd' command will open a terminal in that specific directory of the given path.

4. Now run the following command :

    `node script.js`
